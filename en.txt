first nation to recognize brazilian independence from portugal in two years after its proclamation recognizing the independence of countries of the americas from their european metropolies was a policy of the united states which hoped to undermine european influence in the region during the th century and the first half of the th century interaction between the two was limited to multilateral fora such as the conference of american states at the first panamerican conference many countries of the americas the us and brazil included discussed a series of regional integration projects those ranged from military to economic integration the united states planned to create a panamerican antieuropean economic bloc a customs union it meant to suspend external tariffs applied to interamerican trade but not to europeanamerican trade the bloc would have adopted a single currency the us dollar at the military stage the us also pushed to create a panamerican army its intention would be to protect the whole of the americas from european interventionism in south america both brazil and argentina opposed those plans as both had deep trade ties with europe they would have been the most

europe and africa see also second rubber boom in brazil also sent some contribution in troops to be commanded by the us army in europe vargas who was an admirer of benito mussolini was convinced in so doing by franklin roosevelts promise that the south american country would be granted a permanent seat at the un security council a promise the us was later unable to fulfill due to resistance from the soviet union and the ukbut relations between vargass brazil and the us were strained this was due to the statist and nationalistic economic policy adopted by the brazilian president a policy based on an industrialization plan that was closed to foreign capital investment as part of the plan petrobras still today brazils most profitable enterprise was createdpainting of franklin roosevelt and getúlio vargas visiting an air force basethe presidency of eurico gaspar dutra opened a brief period of democratic rule after ousting of getúlio vargas during the dutras administration brazils foreign policy was aligned closely with that of the united states dutra outlawed the brazilian communist party in and broke off relations with the soviet union in contradiction to the economic nationalism of his predecessor he opened the country for foreign mostly us investments getúlio vargass return to power in now in democratic fashionhowever signaled a cooling of relations and a return to economic nationalism vargas blamed the us for his ouster in and appealed to brazilian nationalism a sentiment that was growing in many sectors including the armed forces in the new vargas mandate the old

with the united states his economic policy attracted huge direct investments by foreign capital much of which came from the us he also proposed an ambitious plan for united states development aid in latin america the panamerican operation the outgoing administration of president dwight eisenhower found the plan of no interest but the administration of president john f kennedy appropriated funds in for the alliance for progressrelations again cooled slightly after president jânio quadros took office he ruled for only some months in quadros was an outandout conservative and his campaign had received support from udn brazils then largest rightwing party which five years later would morph into arena the military dictatorship party but quadross foreign policynamed independent foreign policyquickly eroded his conservative support in an attempt to forge new trade partnerships the brazilian president tried to create closer ties with some communist countries that included cuba quadros openly supported fidel castro during the usled bay of pigs invasion he visited the caribbean nation after the event and when cuban revolutionary ernesto che guevara retributed the visit he was decorated with brazils highest honor as a result of the political instability within the countrysomething provoked by his breakup with the udn and tensions with the militaryquadros resigned at that time his vicepresident joão goulart was on a diplomatic mission in communist chinain that year goulart took office political instability however continued highfor not only goulart kept quadross unusual foreign policy but he also showed a clear leftist streak in domestic affairs he had a protrade union stance and increased the minimum wage by the end of the us downgraded its relations with brazil and reduced aid to the country washingtons worries were that brazil would turn into a nonaligned emerging power such as egypt but those worries dissipated on march on that day a military coup overthrew the civil government a usfriendly military regime replaced itus government support for the coupfurther information operation brother samand brazilian coup détatthough never admitted by the us government the us secretly provided arms and other support for the military coup plotters us government s released on march the th anniversary of the brazilian coup expose the us role an audio tape released that day for instance showed american president lyndon johnson instructing his aides in brazil with these words i think we ought to take every step that we can be prepared to do everything that we need to do us ambassador to brazil lincoln gordon was perhaps the most enthusiastic procoup us authority four days prior to the coup gordon wrote cia agents in detailing how the us should help the plotters if our influence is to be brought to bear to help avert a major disaster herewhich might make brazil the china of the sthis is where both i and all my senior advisors believe our support should be placed to assure the success of the coup gordon recommended that measures be taken soonest to prepare for a clandestine delivery of arms of nonus origin to be made available to castello branco supporters in sao paulo in a subsequent cable declassified february gordon suggested that these weapons be prepositioned prior any outbreak of violence to be used by paramilitary units and friendly military against hostile military if necessary to conceal the us role gordon recommended the arms be delivered via unmarked submarine to be offloaded at night in isolated shore spots in state of sao paulo south of santosin gordon published a bookbrazils second chance en route toward the first worldon brazilian history since the military coup in it he denied his role in the affair on gordons importance for the coup movement however james n green an american brazilianist said in an interview with a brazilian website changed brazils history for he gave green light so the military advanced the coup in he made it clear that if the coup was advanced the united states was going to recognize it immediately which was fundamental media outlets both in brazil and the us hailed the coupthe us immediately recognized the new interim government at the day of the coup a united states naval task force was anchored close to the port of vitória the johnson administration made large loans to the new castelo branco government us government relations with the military governmentthe new military president adopted a policy of almost total alignment with the united states what is good for the united states is good for brazil asserted general juracy magalhães the minister of foreign relations of the castello branco administration in accordance with this thought castello branco took a series of proamerican policies in both the foreign and domestic agendas in he cut ties with cuba and china in he sent troops to santo domingo in support for the united states occupation of the dominican republic he opposed the creation proposed by chile of a latin american trade area that would exclude the us and defended the creation of an interamerican peace force a panamerican military force that would be made up of military contingents of all countries in the americas the force would be headed by the organization of american states and its main function would be to intervene in any nation of the region where there was danger of a leftist revolutionthe role of american diplomats and businessmen in brazilian political life was eyecatching in forming his economic team castello branco took to heart the advice that had been given to him by american officials this one sees in his indication for the planning ministry of roberto campos a useducated monetarist economist together with the minister of finances otávio bulhões campos implemented reforms to both reduce inflation and make the brazilian environment more open to foreign capital those included public spending cuts tax hikes on consumers and wagefreezing to lower inflation massive privatizations elimination of restriction on capital remittances to foreign banks tax cuts to multinational profits and the pulling out of subsidies and legislation that shielded national industries from foreign competitionfrom in annual inflation fell to in in the budget deficit stood at of gdp from in therefore if one takes into account the aims of such economic policies then they can be thought of as effective but they were unpopular with both the broader society and the nationalistic sectors of the military the latter accused the economic team of being sellouts bent on destroying national industries and delivering the country to us multinationals such accusations often appeared in the brazilian press which went mostly uncensored during the period the public attributed to the american government an immense political clout over the brazilian regime an impression encapsulated in a mockcampaign commenced by a humourist otto lara resende whose motto was enough with middlemenlincoln gordon for president gordon himself complained that american advisors were implicated in almost every unpopular decision concerning taxes salaries and pricesthe social consequences of such economic plan the paeg were negative though inflation had been reduced it was still high for international standards and in combination with the wagefreezing policies it caused brazilians real income to fall sharplyby about from to as a consequence malnutrition and infant mortality rose the brazilian industrial elite too began to turn on the government not only it had been hurt by the sudden market opening but also the monetary tightening applied under the paeg had dried out credit and induced a recession in outputthe overall failure of such reforms the increased opposition faced by the castello branco administration even among sectors that had previously supported it its closeness with the us government and its perceived leniency in combatting subversive leftists all this led to the ascension after castello brancos death of a different set of rulers one that would alter brazils political and economic path and its relations with the uspresidents emílio médici and richard nixon in december after his death in castello branco was succeeded by general artur da costa e silva costa e silva received support from brazilian industrialists and from the nationalist wing of the military a more numerous sector than the castellistas the castello branco supporters it is rumoured that even before costa e silva took office he demanded from us ambassador lincoln gordon that he leave brazil before the general assumed the presidency this was provoked by an alleged attempt by gordon to persuade costa e silva not to alter castello brancos economic policies and reestablish the statist developmentalist policies previously imposed by civilian former presidents gordon was replaced by ambassador john w tuthill with green light from the us state department tuthill put into practice operation topsy a procedure intended to reduce the american personnel employed in the us ambassy in brasília as he explained in an article published in a edition of the foreign policy magazine the omnipresen of the american ambassy employee in the brazilian political scene had become a cause of irritation among the increasingly antiamerican populace and the brazilian military which had indicated since costa e silva replaced castello branco that the country would follow its own strategy in political and economic matterson the most part the nixon administration remained positive to the brazilian dictatorship high growth during the costa e silva and médici years excited brazilian nationalistic hopes for a greater international rolehopes of which the us was supportive for brazil was still considered to be one of the developing nations most sympathetic to the united states there was however a cooling on both sides on the us side this was due to fears of being linked with its allys abuses it also distressed the us the increased kidnapping risks that its ambassadors and diplomats faced in brazilian territory during those years the médici tactics of suppression against leftist activists were provoked by the acts of urban socialist guerrillas that began to blossom after the coup one of the favorite targets of such groups were us diplomatsas for the brazilian side the cooling had to do with many factors one of them was the vietnam war and the coming but already clear us defeat an event that would facilitate reducing cooperation with the north american nation other factors werethe intention to increase the countrys profile by forging new partnerships and the insertion of new values in its foreign policy the brazilian government had hopes of playing a larger international role that the nationalists believed should accomplished by becoming a leader among developing nations to do that brazil had to loosen its ties with the capitalist superpower and the developed world in general third worldism was a trademark of the foreign ministry rhetoric a greater rapproachment with africa and the middle east was sought at multilateral economic fora the brazilian diplomacy seeking to advance its economic interests as a developing country acted in synergy with india and the broader nonaligned movement in adopting a revisionist stance towards the rich nations noninterventionism was inserted as a key value in brazils foreign policynot only as a means of pandering to other developing nations but also to shield brazil itself from criticism regarding its domestic politics as a result it began to oppose the recreation of the interamerican peace force the nuclear proliferation issue brazil refused to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty it argued that the treaty was discriminatory for it unjustifiably divided the world in two different kinds of nations first the countries that could be trusted to use their weapons responsibly these were exactly the same countries that by then had already established themselves as nuclear weapon states the united states the soviet union the united kingdom france and china and second there was the rest of the world the countries that would have to give up the possibility of developing nuclear technology and enriching uranium on their own the brazilian government wound up rejecting the npt as an infringement against sovereigntygeisel with carter and first lady rosalynn carter the geisel administration marked a definite cooling of brazilianamerican relations as the united states began to apply high tariffs on brazilian manufactured goods ernesto geisel looked for new trade partners these he would seek mostly in other third world nations but in contrast with costa e silva and médici geisel commenced to reach out to communist countries too in four years before the us brazil reestablished diplomatic ties with china it promptly recognized the independence of fellow portuguesespeaking angola and mozambique two african countries whose independence from portuguese rule had been brought about by socialist revolutions aided by cuba and the soviet union in brazil voted in favour of resolution a un resolution sponsored by muslim nations which equaled zionism with racism only two other latin american countriescuba and mexicohad voted in favour of the bill in supporting it at the expense of israel already then a major us ally brazils intention was to seek closer relations with oilrich arab nations by then brazil imported of the oil it consumed as such it had been greatly affected by the oil crisis an event which had a tremendously negative impact on brazils current account and posed a major threat against its fast growth during the médici yearsas the carter administration replaced that of gerald ford two other very sensitive issueshuman rights and nuclear proliferationcame to the front in the relations between the us government and brazilin brazil and western germany established an agreement of cooperation in nuclear energy for peaceful purposes the agreement was to transfer to brazil the whole cycle of nuclear generation and a factory of nuclear reactors the factory would enable the independent production of nuclear reactors as soon as the united states opposed the agreement in march jimmy carter took measures against both brazil and germany he pressed two american banks the chase manhattan bank and the eximbank to suspend all financing activities negotiated with brazil and halted the supply of enriched uranium to germany he wanted to compel both countries to either renounce the agreement or to revise it so as to give space to the introduction of comprehensive safeguards similar to those established by the npt he also wanted the construction of the nuclear reactor factories to be canceledin the early s tension in the americanbrazilian relations centered on economic questions retaliation for unfair trade practices loomed on the horizon and threatened brazilian exports of steel orange juice commuter aircraft shoes and textiles when president sarney took office in political issues such as brazils arms exports to libya and iran again surfaced brazils foreign debt moratorium and its refusal to sign the nonproliferation treaty caused the united states to put brazil on its mandated blacklist thereby restricting brazils access to certain us technologiesend of cold war return to democracy in brazilon taking office in march president collor sought a quick reapproachment with the united states in order to begin an aggressive policy of inserting brazil into the world economy and placing it at the negotiating table of world powers the franco administration maintained an independent stance and reacted coolly to proposals by the clinton administration for a latin american freetrade zonest centuryrelations with the cardoso government in were good cardoso made a very successful trip to washington and new york in and the clinton administration was very enthusiastic regarding the passage of constitutional amendments that opened the brazilian economy to increasing international participationthe bush administration came to view brazil as a strong partner whose cooperation must be sought in order to solve regional and global problems issues of concern to both brazil and the united states included counternarcotics and terrorism energy security trade environmental issues human rights and hivaidsfollowing the terrorist attacks of brazil was the first to propose invocation of the interamerican treaty of reciprocal assistance also known as the rio treaty which stipulates that an armed attack on one member is to be considered an attack on all the treaty was activated september in a meeting of western hemisphere foreign ministers at the organization of american states on october president cardoso stated that the united states had not requested brazilian military support and that brazil does not intend to offer any despite brazils initial support for the united states it did not opt to actively join the war on terror and under president lula it strongly opposed the bush administrations controversial iraq warthe bilateral relations were nonetheless considered fairly close despite the differing political approaches of lula and bush on various issues on june president lula made an official visit to the united states and he and president bush resolved to create a closer and qualitatively stronger relationship on november president bush visited brasilia and the two leaders reaffirmed the good relations between the countries and pledged to work together to

to islamic prophet muhammad member of the ahl albaytali is regarded as the first imam and is considered along with his descendants to be one of the divinely appointed successors of muhammad who are the only legitimate religious and political leaders of the muslim community though ali was regarded during the lifetime of muhammad as his initial successor it would be years before he was recognized with the title of caliph like the rest of his household ali is considered infallible and sinless he is one of the fourteen infallibles of the household of muhammedtradition states that ali was born in mecca a member of the quraysh tribe alis father and muhammads uncle abu talib ibn abd almuttalib was custodian of the kaaba and a sheikh of the banu hashim an important branch of the powerful tribe of the quraysh his mother was fatimah bint asad who was also from the banu hashim in arab culture this was a great honor for ali that both of his parents belonged to the banu hashim ali was also one of descendants of ishmael the son of abraham during his childhood ali spent his first six years under his fathers roof then as a result of famine in and around mecca muhammad asked his uncle abu talib to allow ali to come and live in the house of his cousin it would be another four years until muhammad would announce his prophethood when the divine command came for muhammad to begin to preach ali only a child of ten years arose and was the first male to publicly announce his support for his cousin over the coming years ali stood firmly in his support of muhammad during the persecution of muslims by the meccansali migrated to medina shortly after muhammad there muhammad told ali that he had been ordered by god to give his daughter fatimah to ali in marriage for the ten years that muhammad led the community in medina ali was extremely active in his service leading parties of warriors on raids and carrying messages and orders with the exception of the battle of tabouk ali took part in all the battles fought for islam during this timeafter the assassination of the third caliph uthman ibn affan the sahabah in medina selected ali to be the new caliph he encountered defiance and civil war during his reign tragically while ali was praying and bowing to god in the great mosque of kufa abdalrahman ibn muljam a kharijite assassin struck him with a poisoncoated sword ali died on the st of ramadan in the city of kufa in ce ali is highly regarded for his knowledge belief honesty devotion to islam loyalty to muhammad his equal treatment of all muslims and his generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies in addition he is respected as the rightful successor of muhammad ali retains his stature as the foremost authority on the tafsir fiqh and religious thoughtthe compilation of sermons lectures and quotations attributed to ali are compiled in the form of several books nahj albalagha is the most revered of them it is considered by historians and scholars to be an important work in islamic literaturecontents early life upbringing muhammads era marriage with fatimah boycott of banu hashim migration to medina succession to muhammad abu bakrs era umars era uthmans era etiquette famous hadith used by the shia works see also references external linksearly lifefatimah bint asad the wife of abu talib ibn abd almuttalib pregnant with ali completed her pregnancy term of days but had not yet been induced into labor to give birth to the postterm baby abu talib suggested to his wife that she perform circumambulations around the kaaba and pray for divine assistance in the midst of performing her rounds she went into labor at one corner of the kaaba designated as the rukne yamani the kaaba split open and she was given a push from behind towards the direction of the openinginside the kaaba fatimah gave birth to ali and it wasnt until muhammad had looked upon the infant that the infants eyelids opened at the time of alis birth a special relationship was hence imparted between muhammad and ali and would be manifested from the time of the muhammads call in the year ad until his death in the year ali would be given the privilege of being to only person to be born inside the kaabain a muslim tradition regarded as authentic by shias and included in mawaddat alqurba and peshawar nights alis mother fatimah bint asad named him after her father asad abu talib did not agree with her and saido fatima let us go to the qubais hills and invoke allah he may tell us the name of this childthe answer to the prayer was ali derived from one of names of god al ali upbringingwhen ali was about six years of age muhammad was granted permission from his uncle abu talib to bring him up as his own child for ten years ali stayed in muhammads care and became inseparable taking on the character of muhammad going so far as to statei was the first to pray to god along with the holy prophetmuhammads eramain article hadith of warningali was the first person to declare in public his belief in muhammad and his message of islamthough ali had been born a muslim his announcement came with muhammads first speech directed to his family about his divinely appointed mission tradition states that when the verse and admonish thy nearest kinsmen was revealed to muhammad he called ali and said to himali god has commanded me to warn my tribe of near kindred i was troubled by this since i knew that when i discuss the matter to them they would respond in a way which i would not like i kept silent until gabriel came to me and said if you do not do what you are commanded your lord will punish you so prepare a measure of wheat for us add a leg of lamb to it fill a large bowl of milk for us and then invite sons of abd almuttalib for me so that i may speak to them what i have been commanded to tell themonce muhammad had gathered the members of banu abd almuttalib he spoke to them sayingbanu abd almuttalib i dont know of any young man among arabs who has brought for his people something better than what i have brought to you i bring the best of this world and the world after since god has commanded me to summon you to him which of you will aid me in this matter so that he will be my brother my executor my successor among youthey all held back from the words of muhammad and though ali was the youngest he repliedi will be your helper o prophet of allah he put his hand on the back of alis neck and said this is my brother my executor my successor among you so listen to him and obey himsome banu abd almuttalib rose up laughing and saying to alis father abu talibhe has commanded you to obey your son and to obey himmarriage with fatimahthe shia believe that the decision of ali to marry fatimah was a perfect union decreed by god in the seventh heaven and given to the angel gabriel to transmit directly to ali it is also believed that due to their sinless and infallible nature there were never any arguments or differences between ali and fatimah and believe that ali never sought the hand of amr ibn hishām daughter in marriage as that would by definition make him fallible as asking for the hand of marriage to an idol worshipper is a sin they also believe that muhammad did not grant him the title abu turab in displeasure but rather from his delight at the battle of alashiraboycott of banu hashimmuhammads denunciation of the meccan traditional religion was especially offensive to his own tribe the quraysh as they were the guardians of the kaaba so they persecuted the muslims according to the tradition the leaders of the banu makhzum and banu abdshams two important clans of the quraysh declared a public boycott against the clan of banu hashim their commercial rival in order to put pressure on the clanat this time muhammad arranged for some of his followers to emigrate to ethiopia the boycott lasted for three years ali stood firmly in support of muhammad during the years of persecution of muslims and the boycott of banu hashim in meccamigration to medinain ce the year of muhammads migration to yathrib ali risked his life by sleeping in muhammads bed to impersonate him and thwart an assassination plot so that muhammad could escape in safety this night is called laylat almabit according to some hadith a verse was revealed about ali concerning his sacrifice on the night of hijrah which says and there is the type of man who gives his life to earn the pleasure of allahali survived the plot but risked his life again by staying in mecca to carry out muhammads instructions to restore to their owners all the goods and properties that had been entrusted to muhammad for safekeeping then he went to medina with fatimah bint asad fatimah and two other womenthen muhammad went on his final hajj and when returning he called all those who were ahead to come back and those who were behind to come ahead they had stopped at a place called khumm muhammad sat on a pulpit made of saddles he then said man kuntu mawla hu fa hadha aliun mawla which is translated as whoevers master i am ali is also his master the sunnis translate it however as whoevers friend i am ali is also his friendsuccession to muhammadafter muhummads death a sudden panic overcame the many tribes within the arabian peninsula the question of succession as to who would receive the caliphate though it was well known through many traditions related by muhammad and in the quran as to who was to succeed muhammad a small number of prominent companions took to the saqifah banu saida or saqifah a roofed building used by the tribe of saida in the city of medina to decide amongst themselves as to who was going to lead the muslims such companions as abu bakr umar ibn alkhattab and sad ibn ubadah who was killed later were present the small secret band of companions exchanged arguments until the majority gave their bayat to abu bakrafter uniting the arabian tribes into a single muslim religious polity in the last years of his life muhammads death in signalled disagreement over who would succeed him as leader of the muslim community while ali and the rest of muhammads close family were washing his body for burial at a gathering attended by a small group of muslims at saqifah a close companion of muhammad named abu bakr was nominated for the leadership of the community others added their support and abu bakr was made the first caliph the choice of abu bakr disputed by some of muhammads companions who held that ali had been designated his successor by muhammad himself th century mirror writing in ottoman calligraphy depicts the phrase ali is the vicegerent of god in both directionslater when fatimah and ali sought aid from the companions in the matter of his right to the caliphate they answered o daughter of the messenger of god we have given our allegiance to abu bakr if ali had come to us before this we would certainly not have abandoned him ali said was it fitting that we should wrangle over the caliphate even before the prophet was buriedfollowing his election to the caliphate abu bakr and umar with a few other companions headed to fatimahs house to force ali and his supporters who had gathered there give their allegiance to abu bakr then it is alleged that umar threatened to set the house on fire unless they came out and swore allegiance with abu bakr then umar set the house on fire and pushed the burnt door on fatimah some sources say upon seeing them ali came out but was put in chains by umar and his companions fatimah in support of her husband started a commotion and threatened to uncover her hair at which abu bakr relented and withdrew ali is reported to have repeatedly said that had there been forty men with him he would have resisted when abu bakrs selection to the caliphate was presented as a fait accompli ali withheld his oaths of allegiance until after the death of fatimah ali did not actively assert his own right because he did not want to throw the nascent muslim community into strifefatimah had asked ali not to allow the caliphate or any of his followers to join in her burial two to three months after her fathers death fatimah herself died as ali was readying her body for burial he felt her broken ribs and started crying at night ali took her body for burial the next day the caliph and his followers wanted to disinter her body to pray over it but ali did not allow thisthis contentious issue caused muslims to later split into two groups sunni and shia shias believe that muhammad explicitly named ali as his successor at ghadir khumm and muslim leadership belonged to him which had been determined by divine orderthe two groups also disagree on alis attitude towards abu bakr and the two caliphs who succeeded him umar and uthman ibn affan sunnis tend to stress alis acceptance and support of their rule while the shia claim that he distanced himself from them and that he was being kept from fulfilling the religious duty that muhammad had assigned to him sunnis maintain that if ali was the rightful successor as ordained by god himself then it would have been his duty as leader of the muslim nation to make war with these people until ali established the decree shias contend that ali did not fight abu bakr umar or uthman because he did not have the military strength and if he had decided to it would have caused a civil war amongst the muslims ali also believed that he could fulfil his role of imamate without fightingali himself was firmly convinced of his legitimacy for caliphate based on his close kinship with muhammad his intimate association and his knowledge of islam and his merits in serving its cause he told abu bakr that his delay in pledging allegiance as caliph was based on his belief of his own prior title ali did not change his mind when he finally pledged allegiance to abu bakr and then to umar and to uthman but had done so for the sake of the unity of islam at a time when it was clear that the muslims had turned away from himaccording to shia historical reports ali maintained his right to the caliphate and saidby allah the son of abu quhafah dressed himself with it and he certainly knew that my position in relation to it was the same as the position of the axis in relation to the handmilli put a curtain against the caliphate and kept myself detached from it i watched the plundering of my inheritance till the first one went his way but handed over the caliphate to ibn alkhattab after himselfabu bakrs eraabu bakr dispatched ali who did participate during the ridda wars against the forces of tulayha a selfproclaimed prophet in july ali did participate during the ridda wars in july against the forces of tulayha a selfproclaimed prophet in the third week of july the apostate army moved from dhu qissa to dhu hussa from where they prepared to launch an attack on medina abu bakr scraped together a fighting force mainly from the clan of mohammad the banu hashim the army had stalwarts like ali ibn abi talib talha ibn ubaidullah and zubair ibn alawam conquer egypt each of them was appointed as commander of onethird of the newly organised force before the apostates could do anything the muslims of medina launched an army against their outposts and drove them back to dhu hussathis discredits some shea sources that claim ali did not give his oath of allegiance to abu bakr until some time after the death of his wife fatimah in the year umars eraali asgher razwy a thcentury shia twelver scholar statesumar on his deathbed had appointed six muhajireen as members of a panel which was to choose one out of themselves as the future khalifa of the muslims they were ali uthman talha zubayr abdur rahman bin auf and saad bin abi waqqas except ali all other members of the panel were capitalists or rather neocapitalists when they came from makkah they were penniless and homeless but within twelve years ie from the death of muhammad mustafa in to the death of umar in each of them except ali had become rich like croesus between these two dates they had accumulated immense wealth and had become the richest men of their timesali did not qualify as a member of this exclusive club but umar admitted him anyway apart from the fact that ali made his living as a gardener whereas his other five comembers lived on the revenues of their lands and estates there was another gulf even more unbridgeable that separated him from them in character personality temperament attitudes philosophy and outlook on life ali and the rest of them were the antithesis of each otheruthmans eraa narration attributed to ali reports`othman ordered that i should have audience with him on a very hot day i placed my garment on my head and went to see him i entered and he was on his bed a rod in hand surrounded by rich wealth two heaps of gold and silver he said `take of this whatever you wish so you may have enough to fill your stomach for you have burnt me i said to him `you have surely been kind to your kin if this wealth is an inheritance which you have inherited or a giver gave it to you personally or you earned it from a trade deal i would then be one of two i may either take of it or simply thank you for your offer or i may refrain so i may work hard but if it is a wealth that belongs to allah and the muslims are to partake of it and so are the orphans and the wayfarers then by allah you have no right to give me any of it nor do i have any right to take any of it he said `i by allah insist that you should do what you have refused to do then he kept hitting me with the rod by allah i did not keep his hand away from me till he had enough i pulled my garment over my head and went back home i said `allah is between you and me if i enjoined on you to do what is right or prohibited you from doing wrongetiquettewhen the shia refer to ali they normally add peace be upon him after it alternatively the phrase allah has honoured his face is also used after his name in

topical local or general anesthesia local anaesthesia is more preferred because it is economical easy to perform and the risk involved is less local anaesthesia has a rapid onset of action and provides a dilated pupil with low intraocular pressurecontents history topical anaesthesia facial block retrobulbar block peribulbar block regional anaesthesia general anaesthesia see also references external linkshistorysusruta samhita has evidences of use of anaesthesia for ocular surgeries inhalational anaesthesia was used for this purpose egyptian surgeons used carotid compression to produce transient ischemia during eye surgery to reduce the perception of pain in karl koller used cocaine for ocular surgery the same year herman knapp used cocaine for retrobulbar block in van lint achieved orbicularis akinesia by local injectiontopical anaesthesiasurface anaesthesia is given by instillation of ml xylocaine one drop of xylocaine instilled four times after every minutes will produce conjunctival and corneal anaesthesia paracaine tetracaine bupivacaine lidocaine etc may also be used in place of xylocaine cataract surgery by phacoemulsification is frequently performed under surface anaesthesia facial nerve which supplies the orbicularis oculi muscle is blocked in addition for intraocular surgeries topical anaesthesia is known to cause endothelial and epithelial toxicity allergy and surface keratopathyfacial blockthere are three types of facial block van lints block atkinson block o brien block and nadbath blockvan lints block in van lints block the peripheral branches of facial nerve are blocked this technique causes akinesia of orbicularis oculi muscle without associated facial paralysis ml of anaesthetic solution is injected just above the eyebrow and below the inferior orbital margin through a point about cm behind the lateral orbital margin in level with the outer canthus of the eyeo briens block it is also known as facial nerve trunk block the block is done at the level of the neck of the mandible near the condyloid process the needle is inserted at this point and about ml of local anaesthetic is injected while withdrawing the needle pain at the injection site may occur if o briens block is appliedatkinsons block the superior branch of the facial nerve are blocked by injecting the anaesthetic solution at the inferior margin of zygomatic bonenadbath block in nadbath block the facial nerve is blocked at the stylomastoid foramen the patient is likely to experience painretrobulbar blockthis technique was first practiced by dr herman knapp in here xylocaine is introduced into the muscle cone behind the eyeball the injection is usually given through the inferior fornix of the skin of outer part of lower lid when the eye is in primary gaze the ciliary nerves ciliary ganglion oculomotor nerve and abducens nerve are anesthetized in retrobulbar block as a result global akinesia anaesthesia and analgesia are produced the superior oblique muscle which is outside the muscle cone is not usually paralyzed the complications of retrobulbar block are globe perforation optic nerve injury retrobulbar haemorrhage and extraocular muscle palsy retrobulbar anaesthesia is contraindicated in posterior staphyloma high axial myopia and enopthalmosperibulbar blockthis technique was first applied by davis in peribulbar block ml of local anaesthetic is injected to the peripheral spaces of the orbit the anaesthetic diffuses into the muscle cone and eyelids causing global and orbicularis akinesia and anaesthesia after injection orbital compression is applied for around minutesregional anaesthesianearly all ocular surgeries viz keratoplasty cataract extraction glaucoma surgery iridectomy strabismus retinal detachment surgery etc can be done under regional anaesthesia conjunctiva globe and orbicularis can be paralysed using a combination of surface anaesthesia facial anaesthesia and retrobulbar block the advantage is that it requires lest post operative restlessness it has less post operative lung complications and less bleedinggeneral anaesthesiageneral anaesthesia is preferred for ocular surgeries in anxious adults psychiatric patients infants and children it is also indicated in perforating ocular injuries and major surgeries like exenteration during the surgery it has to be ensured that no carbon dioxide retention occurs if this occurs the choroid swells up and ocular contents may prolapse as soon as the eye is opened the advantages of general anaesthesia is that it produces complete akinesia controlled intraocular pressure and safe operating environment it is the safest option for bilateral surgery the complications of general anaesthesia are laryngospasm hypotension hypercarbia
