electronic data a byte is two hexadecimal digits when used as a measurement it is basically measuring how many numbers a computer can hold this is useful for things like ram in a computer or storage devices like usb drives and other types of flash memory sending of data is usually measured in bits not bytesone byte is usually equal to eight bits some very early computers had bytes with different numbers of bits an octet is always eight bits in modern usage an octet and a byte are the samecontents abbreviation names for larger units byte chart kilo kibi referencesabbreviationthe symbol for byte is b sometimes a lowercase b is used but this use is incorrect because b is actually the ieee symbol for bit the iec symbol for bit is bit for example mb means megabyte and mbit means megabit the difference is important because megabyte is bytes and megabit is bits or bytes its easy to confuse the two but bits are much smaller than bytes so the symbol bit should be used when referring to bits and an uppercase b when referring to bytesnames for larger unitsfor large data byte is often used with a binary prefixkilobytekibibytemegabytemebibytegigabyteterabytetebibytepetabytepebibyteexabyteexbibytezettabyteyottabytebyte chartaccording to the international electrotechnical commission who sets many computer standards these charts show how bytes should be referred topeople who refer to kilobyte as bytes for example are technically incorrect bytes should be referred to as kibibyte according to the iec however using for kilo and for mega etc was widely practiced before the iec standards were set in there is some confusion and mixing of terms in the marketplacekilo when using standard metric

numeral system rather than the commonlyused decimal numeral system or binary coded decimal system there are many situations where the standard metric system does not work well particularly with memory sizes for a computer or storage device if a memory or storage device uses a binary number for addresses the number of different positions to be accessed can be expressed as a power of rather than a

an important geneticist he was a obstetrician and gynecologist practising in stuttgart in he expressed the principle which would later come to be known as the hardyweinberg law weinberg is also credited as the first to explain the effect of ascertainment bias on observations in geneticscontents life hardyweinberg law ascertainment bias referenceslifeweinberg was born in stuttgart and studied medicine at tübingen and munich receiving an md in he returned to stuttgart in where he remained running a large practice as a gynecologist and obstetrician until he retired to tübingen a few years before his death in much of his academic life was spent studying genetics especially on applying the laws of inheritance in populationshardyweinberg lawmain page hardyweinberg lawweinberg developed the principle of genetic equilibrium independently of british mathematician gh hardy he delivered an exposition of his ideas in a lecture on january about six months before hardys paper was published in english his lecture was printed later that year in the societys yearbookweinbergs contributions were unrecognized in the english speaking world for more than years curt stern a german geneticist who emigrated to the united states before world war ii pointed out in a brief paper in science that weinbergs exposition was both earlier and more comprehensive than hardysascertainment biasweinberg pioneered studies of twins and developed techniques to analyse phenotypic variation his aim was to partition this variance into genetic and environmental components in the process he recognized that ascertainment bias was affecting many of his calculations and he produced methods to correct for itweinberg observed that proportions of homozygotes in familial studies of classic recessive genetic diseases generally exceed the expected mendelian ratio of and he explained how this is the result of ascertainment bias in his work with albino children he recognized that in some families where both parents carry a recessive mutation by chance no albino child occurs he reasoned that many carrier couples were not being counted and he demonstrated methods for correcting results to produce the expected mendelian ratioshe discovered the answer to several seeming paradoxes caused by ascertainment bias for example he explained that the reason that parents as a whole are more fertile than their children is because children must necessarily come from fertile parentsby the same token he recognized that ascertainment was responsible for a phenomenon known as genetic anticipation the tendency for a genetic disease to manifest earlier in life and with increased severity in later generations weinberg recognized that this was because those later generations were the offspring of that selected group of earlier carriers that had successfully reproducedadditional contributions by weinberg to statistical genetics included the first estimate of the rate of twinning realizing that identical twins would have to be the same sex while nonidentical twins could be either same or opposite sex weinberg derived the formula for estimating the frequency of mz and dz twins from the ratio of same and opposite sex twins to the total of maternities weinberg also estimated that the heritability of twinning itself was close to zeroreferences stern curt wilhelm weinberg genetics weinberg w über den
